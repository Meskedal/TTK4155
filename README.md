# TTK4155 - Byggern
This course involved designing an embedded system for a game originally meant to be pong, but later altered to be a keep-up challenge. features of this project included:
* EEPROM Highscore List
* Variation of controller type
  * PID postional controller with slider as input
  * Velocity feedforward with joystick as input
  
The working principle of the system was based on a solenoid to push te ball, motor to to drive along x-axis and a servo motor for the y-axis. Two IR sensors and sources was placed along the box to provide a function for counting points and to check if the game was over.
